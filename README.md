# Introgression_detection
This repository contains the code used in my MSc thesis "Establishing the method for archaic introgression detection in diverse modern populations". (UCL, MSc Genetics and Multiomics in Medicine 2022/23, project supervisor Dr Horia Stanescu)

I have used Skov et al., 2018 Hidden Markov Model for detection of archaic introgression in modern populations (GBR and CHS).  
Bash script required to replicate the analysis can be found in darja_script.sh  
List of individuals' IDs from 1000 Genomes Projects used in the analysis is located in individuals.json   
Code for result processing and generation of figures and tables is available in the output directory.
